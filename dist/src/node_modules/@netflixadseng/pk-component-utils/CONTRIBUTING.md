# Netflix Generic Source - PACKAGE


## Overview
Generic Sources are the building blocks of Monet Containers. There are several types:
 - __Build Templates__
 - __Web Components__
 - __Packages__

Web Components are a flexible, long-standing HTML/CSS/JS framework that is in a good position to become a browser standard. Netflix 
uses the Web Components pattern for its ability to be implemented in a variety of ways: They are supported by Google Web Designer, 
and, with polyfills and some tooling, they can be utilized in agency frameworks.

This scaffold provides tools that make it easier to author, test, maintain, share, and migrate Web Components.




## Installation
`npm install && npm run init`
 - attaches the GS-tracker to GWD-manifest
 - if there is a `./lib/package.json`, then it will also be installed. This allows authors of this scaffold to bundle additional infrastructure, if needed.




## Monet/C20 Compatibility

#### GENERIC SOURCE TRACKING
You will notice a file in your `./src` folder that looks like:

`c73f6129-5748-4609-ae15-a7b0ce6042af.js`

__Do not delete this file!__ In fact, it should be distributed along with your published files.

This tracker file is used by Monet to identify this component. It is in the form of a JS file so that it can
be included in GWD manifest.json as a publishable dependency.

#### DEVELOPMENT vs. PUBLISHED
This switch is here: `package.json -> genericSource.state`. It's options are:
 - `development`: Default state, the component will appear in Monet, but it will not be available for preview or download
 - `published`: Production state, the component will appear in Monet with preview/download links to the `./dist/` folder
 - `disabled`: Disabled state, the component will __not__ appear in Monet





## Development

### SRC
All of your dev should happen in `./src` folder. Add whatever scaffolding & build-dependencies you need to dev/build/maintain this component. 




###### DOCUMENTATION
The `.src/` has it's own `README.md`. Please make use of it to communicate component functionality.





### PUBLISHING
Install this global package https://github.com/sindresorhus/np

Then run `npm run pub`




## Note about this Scaffold
