# Netflix Generic Source - PACKAGE


## Overview
Generic Sources are the building blocks of Monet Containers. There are several types:
 - __Build Templates__
 - __Web Components__
 - __Packages__

Packages are NPM-style collections of Javascript. This is the most abstract type of Generic Source, meant for the development of shared, modular dependencies.

Partners who use their own frameworks can integrate GS-Packages by mapping their `package.json -> dependencies` to this GitHub repo.
